## Character Line View


### Abstract
Ok, all cards on the table. This README.md exists for the sole purpose of redirecting you to the documentation here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5u79kHJnI82h4C0ma6KxWKIAbJ6jP5zzPjsd7e7x-A/edit?usp=sharing

If you want more info, check out my itch.io page where I host Character Line View: https://archerzenmi.itch.io/eeveelution-memes-rpg-dialogue

If any of these links don't work, just google "ArcherZenmi itch.io" and I'm sure it'll pop up.


### Installation
If you want to use CLV, I'd recommend going to itch.io to get the most recent stable version of CLV.

Otherwise, if you're looking for the current unstable version, just drag and drop the "Character Line View" folder into your Unity project.
